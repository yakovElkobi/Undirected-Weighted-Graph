### this project is about undirected weighted graphs.
### it has the following packeges:
## dataStructure - 
### the data structure of undirected weighted graph, can add nodes, delete nodes, connect nodes, get a specific node/edge.
## algorithms -
### some algorithms on graph such as:
### isConnected - returns if the graph is strongly conncted or not
### shortestPathDist - returns the weight of the shortest path between two nodes, shortestPath - returns the path of the shortest path between two nodes
